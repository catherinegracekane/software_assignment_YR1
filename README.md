# software_assignment_YR1

My assignment from first year, Software for the Global Market.

This was designed around creating a product to suit a users needs, I felt it's difficult to find unique and interesting gifts for people, there's a lot of junk websites and a lot of mass production.

This represents a basic outline for having a very succint, clear and easy to navigate website.

There is use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Canvas within the project.
